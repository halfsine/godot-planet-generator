A planet generator in godot that makes unique looking planets using godot shading language.
This is an old project of mine that i made in about a day. You are free to use it however you like, it's licensed under the unlicense.
I'm archiving this because i don't really care about it. I care about it so little, i don't even remember what version of godot it was made in. 
If you DO care about this project and would like to extend it, please do so!
